Congratulations on a job well done! The game is enthralling and your code has shown significant improvement. 
It is well-organized and incredibly straightforward to follow.
My only suggestion would be to incorporate a Database component, such as login and score tables. 
Additionally, integrating an API for the prize element (perhaps a humorous joke or an appealing image) would have been a welcome addition.
Python OOP: 10/10
Databases: 0/10
API/JSON: 0/10
General score: 6
